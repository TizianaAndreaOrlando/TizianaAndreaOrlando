### Hi everybody ðŸ‘‹

My name is Andrea and I'm from Argentina. Currently, I'm doing my Bachelor's degree in Finance focused on the stock market and corporate finances. 
Being a Sophomore/Senior student is an enjoyable stage of my life because I can balance both finance learning and working. 
I'm giving my first steps with Data Analytics and everything involved because I consider that data is such a powerful concept for companies who want to succeed.
To do so, they need capable people that fulfill those needs and here is where I find myself as a good resource for a company. 
Here I will upload my projects to improve my knowledge and grow professionally. 

### My values

-Rookie but with initiative and power of will.

-Efficiency and effectiveness.

-I see teamwork as an opportunity to open an individual's mind.

### Goals 2023

-Improve my Python skills.

-To deep dive into the programming world.
