### Hi everybody 👋

My name is Andrea and I'm from Argentina. At the moment I'm a Bachelor's degree finance student focused on the stock market. 
🐾 I'm giving my first steps with Data Analytics and everything involved 🐾. 
Here I will upload my projects to improve my knowledge and grow professionally. 

### My values

-Rookie but with initiative and power of will.

-Efficiency and effectiveness.

-I see teamwork as an opportunity to open an individual's mind.

### Goals 2021


-Improve my Python skills.

-Learning Data visualization tools. 

-Improve my soft skills to work better in teams.

-Learn languages.



### Fun fact

-I love to learn everything. Especially how things work. 

-Also, I do love learning languages.
At the moment I can speak Spanish English and a little bit of German. Hope by the end of 2022 reach a B1 German level. 
Why I'm a language lover? Basically I consider that communication is a skill we must achieve and improve to grow as human beings,
being abble to understand with other culters opens a one's mind and makes you think how life works from other perspectives.
